# Roll Cage

An experimental CSS grid system with focus on responsiveness,
simple and easy to read syntax, and getting the job done.

There is also a JavaScript implementation. (Coming soon.)

```
<roll class='jc-around'>
      <cage cols=' xs-12 '>
          I am 12 columns wide on xs screens.
      </cage>
      <cage cols=' xs-12 md-8 lg-4 '>
          I am 12 columns on xs, 8 on md, and
          4 on anything larger than lg screens.
      </cage>
      <cage cols=' all-6 '>
          I am 6 columns wide on all screens!
      </cage>
    </roll>
```
